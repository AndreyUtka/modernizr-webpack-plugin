# modernizr-webpack-plugin

Generate a custom modernizr build during webpack compile

Tasks to be complete for beta version

- [x] Integrate with html-webpack-plugin (name hashing and script tags)
- [x] Minify via NODE_ENV and/or options param 
- [ ] Write tests 
- [ ] Write documentation

Additional options to consider

- [ ] Option to inject into root application clusters for single file output??
- [ ] Auto generate modernizr options from source code like customizr can 

Help and / or suggestions are appreciated :thumbsup:
